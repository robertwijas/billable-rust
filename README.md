# Billable

![status](https://github.com/robertwijas/billable-rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

A simple command line utility that displays monthly reports for billable hours.
It integrates with [Toggl](http://track.toggl.com/) and [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com).

The key feature is the ability to set monthly goal for each client.
Billable provides monthly estimates, daily and weekly targets based on the definied goal.

# billable -s -m 2
